Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide for configuring RIP routing protocol across four routers and two PCs in detail.

### **Step 1: Set Up Routers**
1. **Select the Routers**:  
   - 1 **Cisco 1841 Router**
   - 1 **Cisco 2811 Router**
   - 2 **Cisco 2620XM Routers**

2. **For each router:**
   a. **Click on the router** to open its configuration.  
   b. **Turn the router off** by clicking the power button in the simulation workspace.  
   c. **Drag and drop the WIC-2T module** into slot 0 (this is to add serial ports).  
   d. **Turn the router back on** by clicking the power button again.  

---

### **Step 2: Connect PCs and Routers**
1. **Connect the PCs to Routers**:  
   Use a **Copper Cross-over cable** to connect each PC to the corresponding router.  
   - For example, **PC1** connects to **Router0's FastEthernet0/0** and **PC2** connects to **Router3's FastEthernet0/0**.  

2. **Connect the Routers via Serial Links**:  
   Use a **Serial DTE cable** to connect the routers as follows:  
   - Router0 → Router1 (via Serial0/0/0)  
   - Router1 → Router2 (via Serial0/0/0)  
   - Router2 → Router3 (via Serial0/0/0)  

---

### **Step 3: Assign IP Addresses to Routers' Interfaces**
For each router, assign IP addresses to both the **Serial** and **Ethernet** interfaces.

#### **Router0 Configuration**:
1. **Enter CLI**:  
   - Click on **Router0**, go to the CLI (Command Line Interface), and enter configuration mode:
     ```bash
     enable
     config t
     ```

2. **Configure Serial Interface (for Router0 to Router1)**:
   ```bash
   interface serial 0/0/0
   ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

3. **Configure Ethernet Interface** (for Router0 to PC1):
   ```bash
   interface fastEthernet 0/0
   ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

4. **Configure RIP**:  
   Enable RIP routing and advertise the networks:
   ```bash
   router rip
   version 2
   network 192.168.10.0
   network 10.10.10.0
   exit
   ```

---

#### **Router1 Configuration**:
1. **Enter CLI**:
   ```bash
   enable
   config t
   ```

2. **Configure Serial Interface (for Router1 to Router2)**:
   ```bash
   interface serial 0/0/0
   ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

3. **Configure Ethernet Interface** (for Router1 to PC2):
   ```bash
   interface fastEthernet 0/0
   ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

4. **Configure RIP**:
   ```bash
   router rip
   version 2
   network 192.168.20.0
   network 10.10.10.0
   exit
   ```

---

#### **Router2 Configuration**:
1. **Enter CLI**:
   ```bash
   enable
   config t
   ```

2. **Configure Serial Interface (for Router2 to Router3)**:
   ```bash
   interface serial 0/0/0
   ip address 10.10.10.5 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

3. **Configure Ethernet Interface** (for Router2 to PC3, assuming you have another PC):
   ```bash
   interface fastEthernet 0/0
   ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

4. **Configure RIP**:
   ```bash
   router rip
   version 2
   network 192.168.30.0
   network 10.10.10.0
   exit
   ```

---

#### **Router3 Configuration**:
1. **Enter CLI**:
   ```bash
   enable
   config t
   ```

2. **Configure Serial Interface (for Router3 to Router2)**:
   ```bash
   interface serial 0/0/0
   ip address 10.10.10.6 255.255.255.252
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

3. **Configure Ethernet Interface** (for Router3 to PC2):
   ```bash
   interface fastEthernet 0/0
   ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   exit
   ```

4. **Configure RIP**:
   ```bash
   router rip
   version 2
   network 192.168.40.0
   network 10.10.10.0
   exit
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Assign IP Addresses to PCs**
Each PC should be assigned an IP address within the subnet of the Ethernet interface it is connected to.

#### **PC1 (connected to Router0)**:
- IP Address: 192.168.10.2
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1 (Router0’s FastEthernet interface)

#### **PC2 (connected to Router3)**:
- IP Address: 192.168.40.2
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Default Gateway: 192.168.40.1 (Router3’s FastEthernet interface)

---

### **Step 5: Verify Routing and Test Connectivity**
1. **Verify RIP Configuration**:
   On each router, check the routing table and RIP configuration:
   ```bash
   show ip route
   show ip protocols
   show ip rip database
   ```

2. **Check RIP Routing Tables**:  
   Ensure that the routers have learned the appropriate routes via RIP. For example, **Router0** should have routes for 192.168.20.0, 192.168.30.0, and 192.168.40.0.

3. **Ping Test**:  
   - From **PC1**, ping **PC2**:
     - Open the **command prompt** on **PC1**.
     - Run the command:  
       ```bash
       ping 192.168.40.2
       ```

4. **Verify that the pings are successful**, which confirms that the RIP protocol is functioning properly and the routers can route traffic between different subnets.

---

### **Step 6: Simulate the Network**
1. **In the Simulation Mode**:
   - Open the **Simulation tab** at the top of the screen.
   - Under **Add Filters**, click to **Remove All** filters, and then **add ICMP and RIP** filters. This will allow you to see the RIP updates and ICMP (ping) requests during the simulation.

2. **Send PDU**:  
   - In simulation mode, you can manually add a **PDU** (Protocol Data Unit), which is typically an ICMP Echo Request (ping), and see how the routers process the request.

---

### **Final Testing and Troubleshooting**
- If the pings do not succeed, check the following:
  1. Verify all interfaces are up (no shutdown).
  2. Confirm correct IP addresses and subnet masks.
  3. Check if RIP version 2 is enabled.
  4. Ensure that the default gateway of each PC is configured correctly.
  5. Ensure that the **serial links** between routers are properly connected and configured.

Once the configuration is correct, your RIP setup will allow communication between the two PCs through the routers.

---

### **Summary of Key Steps:**
- Configure each router’s **serial** and **Ethernet** interfaces.
- Enable **RIP routing protocol** and advertise the connected networks.
- Ensure each **PC** has the correct IP address and gateway.
- **Verify routing tables** on the routers and use **ping** to confirm connectivity.
- **Use the simulation** feature to observe the behavior of the network.

These steps should fully configure and test your RIP routing setup.
