Explanation of the Code:

    Bucket Size: We define the bucket size as 10 bytes (this is the maximum amount of data that can be held in the bucket).
    Outgoing Rate: The outgoing rate is set to 1 byte per second.
    Packet Arrivals: We simulate packet arrivals at given times (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 19 seconds), with each packet having a size of 4 bytes.
    Bucket Operations:
        Every second, if there's data in the bucket, 1 byte is sent out (the outgoing rate).
        Packets that arrive are added to the bucket only if there is enough space. If the bucket overflows, the packet is rejected.
    Tracking Conforming and Non-Conforming Packets: The program keeps count of how many packets conform (fit in the bucket) and how many are rejected due to overflow.

Explanation:

    Replenishment rate (r): Tokens are added to the bucket at 10 KB per second. Every 0.5 seconds, tokens are replenished by 10 * 0.5 = 5 KB.
    Bucket size (b): The bucket can hold up to 50 KB.
    Sender interval: The sender attempts to send a packet of size 15 KB every 0.5 seconds.
    Packet queueing: If there are not enough tokens to send a packet, it gets queued. We keep track of queued packets.
    Token bucket simulation: The program runs the simulation for a total time of 1.5 seconds, and based on this, calculates:
        Tokens left after 1.5 seconds.
        Time until packets start queuing (i.e., when there are not enough tokens to send a packet).
        Maximum possible burst size when the maximum rate (R = 20 KBps) is enforced.
